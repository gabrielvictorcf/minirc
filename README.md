# minirc
A (minimal) implementation of an IRC client and server.

This is the final project for a Computer Networks course as ICMC@USP, where we were
tasked to implement a version of the [IRC RFC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1459).

## How to
1. Open two terminals (or have two hosts in the same network)
2. In each terminal, run `make run`
3. Now you can just start chatting!
